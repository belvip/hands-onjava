# File-Based Student Management System

This is a simple File-Based Student Management System built using Java. It allows users to manage student records, including adding, searching, updating, and deleting student information.

## Features

- Add new student records.
- Search for students by ID or name.
- Update existing student records.
- Delete student records.
- Display all student records.
- Persist data in a text file for future access.

## Steps to Build the Application

### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. **Create the Project Directory**:
   - Create a new Java project folder for the File-Based Student Management System.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     mkdir file-based-student-management
     cd file-based-student-management
     ```

2. **Initialize the Project**:
   - Create the `Main.java` file where all the main logic will reside.
   - Set up your Java environment if necessary (install Java if not already installed).

### Step 2: Define Student Class
1. **Create a Student Class**:
   - Define a `Student` class with attributes such as ID, name, age, and major.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class Student {
         private String id;
         private String name;
         private int age;
         private String major;

         // Constructor, Getters, and Setters
     }
     ```

### Step 3: File Handling
1. **Create Methods for File Operations**:
   - Implement methods for reading from and writing to a text file using Java File I/O.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void saveStudentsToFile(List<Student> students) {
         // Logic to write students to a file
     }

     public List<Student> loadStudentsFromFile() {
         // Logic to read students from a file
     }
     ```

### Step 4: Managing Student Records
1. **Create a List to Store Students**:
   - Define an `ArrayList<Student>` to hold the student records.
   - Example:
     ```java
     List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
     ```

2. **Add Methods to Manage Students**:
   - Write methods to add, search, update, and delete student records.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void addStudent(Student student) {
         students.add(student);
     }

     public Student searchStudentById(String id) {
         // Logic to find a student by ID
     }
     ```

### Step 5: Display Student Records
1. **Create a Method to Display All Students**:
   - Implement a method to display all students in the list.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void displayStudents() {
         for (Student student : students) {
             System.out.println(student);
         }
     }
     ```

### Step 6: Implement User Interaction
1. **Create a User Interface**:
   - Implement a simple console menu for user interaction to manage student records.
   - Example:
     ```java
     public void showMenu() {
         // Display options for the user
     }
     ```

### Step 7: Final Testing and Running the Application
1. **Test All Functionalities**:
   - Test the features for adding, searching, updating, and deleting student records.
   - Print out results to ensure everything works as expected.

2. **Compile the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project directory where your Java files are located.
   - Compile the Java files using the following command:
     ```bash
     javac -d bin src/Main.java src/Student.java
     ```
   - Note: Adjust the paths according to your project structure if necessary.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Run the compiled Java application using the following command:
     ```bash
     java -cp bin Main
     ```

### Step 8: Skills Learned
- Java Programming: Enhanced understanding of Java syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming principles.
- File Handling: Gained skills in reading from and writing to files using Java File I/O.
- Collections Framework: Utilized Java's collections (ArrayList) for managing data effectively.
- Basic Algorithms: Implemented simple algorithms for managing student data.
- Software Design: Developed skills in structuring a Java application and implementing core functionalities.
- Debugging and Testing: Gained experience in debugging Java applications and validating functionalities through testing.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java`: Contains the core logic for the File-Based Student Management System.
- `Student.java`: Defines the Student class with attributes and methods.

## How to Run the Project
